# aa-sample-proposal
## A preview of the candidate, not a SOW.
This is a sample proposal for AA, meant to demonstrate interest and holistic capability in developing foundational data and machine learning solutions tailored to AA's current stage. This demo makes sweeping, albeit reasonably informed, assumptions about AA and may not be valid in light of forthcoming privileged details. It is not a statement of work, but rather should serve as a preview of my approach to problem discovery, communication, and execution in the context of my proposed role at AA.

## LLM use clause
All documents and code were written solely by me, Joe Nance, and not an LLM. Although an LLM was used in instances of debugging and domain knowledge discovery, the body of work in this repo is my own work, and I am happy to answer to any and all questions about design choices, trade-offs, assumptions, etc. in-person.
